# SecureShare - Intelligent File Sharing System

## üîñ Project Title & Description

**SecureShare** is a modern, secure file sharing platform that makes transferring files over the internet simple, fast, and secure. Built for individuals and teams who need to share files quickly without compromising on security or ease of use.

### Target Users
- Remote teams needing secure file collaboration
- Content creators sharing large media files
- Students and educators exchanging documents
- Anyone who values privacy and security in file transfers

### Why It Matters
Current file sharing solutions often compromise between ease of use and security. SecureShare bridges this gap by providing:
- End-to-end encryption for all file transfers
- Temporary, expiring share links for enhanced security
- Real-time transfer progress and notifications
- Cross-platform compatibility with intuitive UI

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Framework**: FastAPI (for high-performance async API)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (user data, file metadata)
- **File Storage**: MinIO (S3-compatible object storage)
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with refresh mechanism
- **Background Tasks**: Celery with Redis
- **Encryption**: Cryptography library (AES-256-GCM)

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **File Upload**: React Dropzone with progress tracking
- **HTTP Client**: Axios with interceptors

### Infrastructure & DevOps
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI 3.0 (auto-generated by FastAPI)
- **Testing**: pytest (backend), Vitest (frontend)
- **Linting**: Black, isort, ESLint, Prettier
- **Environment**: Environment-based configuration

## üß† AI Integration Strategy

### üß± Code Generation & Scaffolding
**Primary Tool**: Claude Code CLI for intelligent code generation

**Approach**:
- Use AI to generate FastAPI route handlers with proper type hints and validation
- Scaffold React components with TypeScript interfaces
- Generate database models with SQLAlchemy relationships
- Create API client functions with proper error handling

**Sample Workflow**:
```
"Generate a FastAPI endpoint for file upload with these requirements:
- Accept multipart form data
- Validate file size (max 500MB)
- Generate unique file ID
- Store metadata in PostgreSQL
- Return upload progress endpoint URL"
```

### üß™ Testing Support
**Strategy**: AI-generated comprehensive test suites

**Backend Testing**:
- Generate pytest fixtures for database models
- Create integration tests for API endpoints
- Mock external services (MinIO, Redis)
- Generate edge case scenarios

**Frontend Testing**:
- Component unit tests with React Testing Library
- Integration tests for file upload flows
- Mock API responses for testing

**Sample Prompt**:
```
"Generate a comprehensive test suite for the file upload component that:
- Tests drag-and-drop functionality
- Validates file type restrictions
- Mocks upload progress updates
- Tests error states (network failure, file too large)
- Includes accessibility testing"
```

### üì° Schema-Aware Generation
**Database Schema Integration**:
- Use SQLAlchemy models as context for generating API endpoints
- Generate TypeScript interfaces from OpenAPI schema
- Create form validation schemas matching database constraints

**API-Aware Development**:
- Feed OpenAPI spec to AI for generating client-side API calls
- Generate React hooks for data fetching based on API schema
- Create consistent error handling patterns across all endpoints

**Context Feeding Strategy**:
```
"Based on this SQLAlchemy model definition and OpenAPI schema:
[paste schema]
Generate a React component that creates a new file share with:
- Form validation matching backend constraints
- Proper TypeScript types
- Error handling for all API response codes
- Loading states and success feedback"
```

### üîß Documentation & Code Quality
**AI-Assisted Documentation**:
- Generate comprehensive docstrings for all functions
- Create inline comments explaining complex algorithms
- Maintain up-to-date README sections
- Generate API documentation examples

**Code Review Support**:
- Use AI for PR reviews focusing on security best practices
- Identify potential performance bottlenecks
- Suggest code refactoring opportunities
- Ensure consistent coding patterns

## ü§ñ In-Editor/PR Review Tooling

**Primary Tool**: Claude Code CLI integration
- Real-time code suggestions and completions
- Context-aware debugging assistance
- Automated code review comments
- Commit message generation

**PR Review Process**:
- AI-assisted security vulnerability scanning
- Performance impact analysis
- Code style consistency checks
- Test coverage recommendations

## üéØ Prompting Strategy

### Feature Development Prompts
```
"Create a secure file sharing endpoint that:
- Implements AES-256-GCM encryption
- Generates temporary download links (24h expiry)
- Logs access attempts for audit
- Returns proper HTTP status codes
- Includes comprehensive error handling
Context: [paste relevant schema/models]"
```

### Testing Prompts
```
"Generate integration tests for the file encryption service covering:
- Successful encryption/decryption cycle
- Invalid key scenarios
- Corrupted file handling
- Performance benchmarks for large files
- Memory usage optimization tests"
```

### Security-Focused Prompts
```
"Review this authentication middleware for security vulnerabilities:
[paste code]
Focus on: JWT validation, timing attacks, rate limiting, and secure headers"
```
